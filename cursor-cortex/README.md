# Cursor-Cortex

A comprehensive knowledge management system for development projects that applies systems thinking principles to transform tacit knowledge into organizational memory.

## Overview

Cursor-Cortex addresses a critical challenge in software development: the loss of valuable tacit knowledge when team members transition or leave. By integrating with existing development workflows and tools, it creates a seamless knowledge capture and retrieval system that enhances project outcomes and organizational learning.

> "An organization is only as good as its people, but its future depends on how well it retains their knowledge."

## Key Features

- **Tacit Knowledge Capture**: Convert expertise and experience into documented, shareable knowledge
- **Completion Checklists**: Track project progress while ensuring knowledge documentation
- **Knowledge Graph**: Visualize relationships between knowledge artifacts
- **Jira Integration**: Synchronize project status and extract knowledge from tickets
- **Systems Thinking Approach**: Identify feedback loops and optimize knowledge flow

## Project Structure

This repository contains the design and implementation plan for Cursor-Cortex:

- [Implementation Plan](implementation-plan.md): Detailed project timeline and team structure
- [Architecture](cursor-cortex-architecture.md): System architecture diagram and component descriptions
- [Tacit Knowledge Template](tacit-knowledge-template.md): Template for capturing tacit knowledge
- [Completion Checklist Template](completion-checklist-template.md): Template for project tracking

## Systems Thinking Approach

Cursor-Cortex applies systems thinking principles to knowledge management by:

1. **Identifying Feedback Loops**: Creating reinforcing loops that encourage knowledge contribution
2. **Managing Knowledge Flow**: Optimizing the path from tacit to explicit knowledge
3. **Recognizing Interconnections**: Mapping relationships between knowledge artifacts
4. **Balancing System Dynamics**: Addressing both short-term project needs and long-term knowledge retention

## Implementation Timeline

The project will be implemented in four phases over 16 weeks:

1. **Foundation** (Weeks 1-4): Core functionality and integration with existing systems
2. **Jira Integration** (Weeks 5-8): Project management synchronization
3. **Knowledge Graph** (Weeks 9-12): Advanced visualization and relationship mapping
4. **Tacit Knowledge Capture** (Weeks 13-16): Sophisticated knowledge extraction and retrieval

## Contributing

## Future Directions

Future enhancements planned for Cursor-Cortex include:

- AI-powered knowledge extraction from code and communications
- Cross-project knowledge sharing
- Predictive analytics to identify potential issues
- External knowledge integration with industry repositories

## Why Knowledge Management Matters

Knowledge management is critical for organizational success:

- **Prevents Knowledge Loss**: Retains valuable expertise when team members leave
- **Accelerates Onboarding**: Helps new team members become productive faster
- **Reduces Repeated Errors**: Ensures lessons learned are shared and applied
- **Improves Decision Making**: Provides historical context for better choices
- **Fosters Innovation**: Enables building on previous insights and discoveries

By transforming individual knowledge into organizational memory, Cursor-Cortex creates a lasting competitive advantage for development teams.
