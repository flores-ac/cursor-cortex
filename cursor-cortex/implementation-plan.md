## Success Metrics

### Usage Metrics
- Number of knowledge artifacts created
- Frequency of knowledge retrieval
- Distribution of contributions across team
- Coverage of project areas in knowledge base

### Business Impact
- Reduction in onboarding time for new team members
- Decrease in repeated errors or issues
- Improvement in project estimation accuracy
- Increase in code reuse and solution sharing

### Knowledge Quality
- Comprehensiveness of documentation
- Accuracy of captured knowledge
- Usefulness ratings from team members
- Applicability of knowledge to new situations

## Risk Management

### Identified Risks
1. **Low Adoption**: Team members may resist additional documentation steps
2. **Knowledge Fragmentation**: Information could be scattered across systems
3. **Maintenance Overhead**: System may require significant upkeep
4. **Integration Complexity**: Connecting with existing tools might be challenging

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Seamless Integration**: Minimize additional steps by integrating with existing workflows
2. **Centralized Repository**: Create single source of truth with appropriate linking
3. **Automation**: Implement automatic capture where possible to reduce manual effort
4. **Phased Approach**: Start with high-value integration points to demonstrate benefit

## Future Enhancements (Post-Phase 4)
