RULE: "Document the Journey, Not Just the Destination"

Real Cursor-Cortex usage patterns from this project show:

üí≠ CAPTURE DISCOVERY MOMENTS:
- "Variable scope issues in JavaScript are critical" (from lessons learned)
- "Context files ‚â† Branch notes" (different purposes, different updates)
- "JSON-RPC protocol breaks with console.log()" (debugging insight)

üîç ASK WHAT WE ALREADY KNOW:
- Search tacit knowledge BEFORE implementing
- Check for "post-mortems" and "lessons learned" docs
- Look for patterns in how problems were solved before

üìù DOCUMENT WHAT YOU LEARN:
- WHY decisions were made, not just WHAT was decided
- Edge cases and gotchas that bit you
- When approaches work vs when they don't

üîÑ BUILD ON WHAT EXISTS:
- Enhance tools rather than rebuild them
- Reference related documentation
- Connect new knowledge to existing patterns

The project itself shows proper use - it's not about rules, it's about naturally documenting your thinking process as you work.
